I prepared this project for my software engineering course and this is my first app work. It has very simple and understandable method called findWordGivenRange(ArrayList<String>, int, in, String)

demoApp has four inputs in this order:

1)String ArrayList

2)Starting index of search (included)

3)Last index of search (included)

4)Key String, that will be searched in the given ArrayList between given indexes

This app returns boolean value:
If given key is in the given list and indexes, it returns true.
It returns false otherwise.


Note: demoApp also returns "false" if inputs do not consistent with above order or inconsistent type.
